I was expecting to see something like `(' or `\{' or
`\}' here. If you typed, e.g., `{' instead of `\{', you
should probably delete the `{' by typing `1' now, so that
braces don't get unbalanced. Otherwise just proceed.
Acceptable delimiters are characters whose \delcode is
nonnegative, or you can use `\delimiter <delimiter code>'.

! Missing \right. inserted.

l.57 \left
           ( e(k)+e(k-1) \right )/2&\text{if} \quad isEnabled()\\
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

! Missing \endgroup inserted.

I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then

                                 /2&\text{if} \quad isEnabled()\\
I'm ignoring a \right that had no matching \left.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

! Undefined control sequence.
l.57 \left ( e(k)+e(k-1) \right )/2&\text
                                         {if} \quad isEnabled()\\
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

                   \endgroup 
l.59 \end{cases}
                
The `$' that I just saw supposedly matches a previous `$$'.
So I shall assume that you typed `$$' both times.

! Extra \endgroup.

Things are pretty mixed up, but I think the worst is over.
